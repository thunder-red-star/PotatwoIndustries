This is a Potato Industries reboot.
## Backstory
So Nick the Potato created Potato Cat, which was his all purpose Discord bot for whatever you might expect. Moderation, miscellaneous, and after, economy commands.

But apparently he got tired of Potato Cat and decided to make a new bot. Potato Industries.

Potato Industries is a bot that basically does Potato Cat's job, but with more of an economy aspect. It was cleaner (as much as you can do in discord.py) and had more commands. Many (and I mean many) people used it, and it was a success. It currently is in 97 servers.

At a certain point, Nick, Christina, and I made a planning Google Doc for the project. It was really ambitious, and we ended up not really finishing everything. 

Well, guess what this is.

**A rewrite of Potato Industries.**

In Discord.js. 

Hence, Potato Industries is now PotaTwo Industries.
